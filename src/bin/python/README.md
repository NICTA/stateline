Requirements to Run Visualisations
==================================
- Python 2.7 or above
- Numpy and Matplotlib
- Visvis

Visualisation Scripts
=====================
Currently we have only a simple example script of visualising results from
Obsidian. Just run visWorld with the input argument being an output from Mason
(The obsidian post-processor). Be careful not to include too many states in the
mason file as otherwise you'll be visualising for a long time!

For details of the script usage just run visWorld -h.
