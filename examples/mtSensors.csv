# MtSensors: This file gives a list of locations and frequencies for 1DMT
# measurements.  The columns are x,y,z in metres, followed by a lest of all
# frequencies taken at that location. The frequencies are in Hz.  Note that the
# positions are not offsets from the world boundaries so if your world doesn't
# start from zero be careful that the sensors are actually placed inside the
# world. An error should be flagged if if they don't. Positive Z values are
# going into the ground.
