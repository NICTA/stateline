# SimulationCtrlPoints: gives true control point values used to simulate sensor
# observations. The top left of this file is the northern-most, western-most
# control point.  All numbers are metres, and positive numbers indicate
# increasing depth. These values are still considered pertubations from the
# offset surface associated with this boundary.
