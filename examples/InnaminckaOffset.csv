# Offset: This is a mean heightmap giving the prior mean of a particular
# boundary. Control points deform this offset. This file can be high resolution
# (much greater than the number of control points for instance), because linear
# interpolation is used to create voxelisations.
# The top left of this file is
# the northern-most, western-most depth value. Positive number indicate
# increasing depth. Units are in metres, except if BoundariesAreTimes flag is
# true (and it is not the first layer), in which case they are in seconds and
# represent two-way times. The distances are computed through the P-wave
# velocity parameter.
