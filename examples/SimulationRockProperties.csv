# SimulationRockProperties: The true rock properties for this layer that will
# be used to generate sensor measurements for a simulation.
# In Order: 
# Density in kg/m^3
# LogSusceptibility  in Log(unitless) 
# ThermalConductivity in Watts/(metres Kelvin)
# ThermalProductivity in Watts/metre^3
# LogResistivityX in Log(ohm metres)
# LogResistivityY in Log(ohm metres)
# LogResistivityZ in Log(ohm metres)
# ResistivityPhase in degrees between 0 and 90
# PWaveVelocity in metres/second 
#
# All logs are assumed to be base 10.
