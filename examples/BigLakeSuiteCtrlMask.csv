# Mask file: Ones or zeros in the shape of the control points for a particular
# layer. Ones indicate that control point is allowed to vary, while a zero
# indicates it is fixed as a constant and ignored by the inference. This file
# is how the number of control points in each layer are specified. Add more
# numbers to this mask to increase the number of control points. Control points
# are always distributed evenly over a grid the size of the world dimensions
# input in the obsidian file.
# The top left of this file is the northern-most, western-most control point.
