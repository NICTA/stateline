# CtrlMin: gives the minimum value a control point can move away from the given
# offset. Note this is not the same as the min of the boundary's movement,
# which is a more complex function of all the control points in the boundary.
# The top left of this file is the northern-most, western-most control point.
# All numbers are metres, and positive numbers indicate increasing depth.
