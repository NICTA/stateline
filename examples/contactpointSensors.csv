# ContactPointSensors: This file specifies the location of drillholes that have
# intersected surfaces defined in the problem. The data should be input as
# x,y,b1,b2,.. where the 'b1' and 'b2' are integers denoting which layers were
# intersected. For example, if a drillhole intersected boundaries the first and
# third boundary and was at location 100,200 the line would be
# 100,200,0,2
# Note that indices start from 0, and distances are in metres with positive
# metres being further under the ground
