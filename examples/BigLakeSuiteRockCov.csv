# RockCov: This file represents the covariance matrix for the multivariate
# Gaussian prior over all the rock properties. The order of rock properties is
# the same in this file as in the mean file.
# In Order: 
# Density in kg/m^3
# LogSusceptibility  in Log(unitless) 
# ThermalConductivity in Watts/(metres Kelvin)
# ThermalProductivity in Watts/metre^3
# LogResistivityX in Log(ohm metres)
# LogResistivityY in Log(ohm metres)
# LogResistivityZ in Log(ohm metres)
# ResistivityPhase in degrees between 0 and 90
# PWaveVelocity in metres/second 
#
# All logs are assumed to be base 10.
