stateline
=========
Stateline is a framework for distributed Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling written in C++ with high-level Python bindings. It focuses on [parallel tempering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_tempering) methods which are highly parallelisable.

System Support
--------------
Currently, stateline runs on Linux-based operating systems only.

Compiler Support
----------------
Stateline has been compiled and tested under g++ 4.8.2.

Prerequisites
-------------
Stateline requires the following libraries as prerequisites:

* Boost 1.55
* Eigen 3.2.0
* google-log (glog) 0.3.3
* google-test (gtest) 1.7.0
* zeromq 4.0.3
* cppzeromq 2358037407 (commit hash)
* leveldb 1.15.0

Building
--------
There is a `build.sh` script included with the code in that can be used to easily build the project using CMake, by specifying environment variables corresponding to the locations of the prerequisite libraries. If you have installed them all into `/usr/local`, you can probably ignore them and just run CMake. Once you have run CMake in your build directory, a simple make command will suffice to build the project.

Documentation
-------------

Documentation can be found in the
[wiki](http://github.com/NICTA/stateline/wiki), and there is automatic doxygen
documentation generated by running 

  make doc

after CMake. Please ensure Doxygen is installed. Finally, there are
well-commented demos for python and C++ in the python/demos folder and src/bin
respectively.

Licence
-------
Please see the LICENSE file, and COPYING and COPYING.LESSER.
